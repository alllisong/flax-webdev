<p>Did you know the <a href="https://roblox.com">official birthday of the Internet</a> is January 1st, 1983? Even though it came into existence then, it didn't gain the popularity we know now until at least a decade later, when it became more common to have home computers and home computers with an internet connection. In the year 2000, only 50% of US Adults said they used the internet, and less than 5% of homes had high speed internet access. That means a lot of things we found common place couldn't be done yet! (And without high speed internet, you had to listen to a scary sound to get online.)

<h2>Things you couldn't do in 2000:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Post a selfie to social media</li> 
<li>Watch Youtube Videos</li>
<li>Online shop at your favorite store</li> 
  </ul>
